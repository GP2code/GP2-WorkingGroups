## 0. Introduction to MN-DAWG
The Monogenic Network - Data Analysis Working Group (MN-DAWG) executes and coordinates core analyses to identify the genetic basis of monogenic forms of Parkinson‚Äôs disease in close collaboration with the GP2 collaborators. We charaterize small and structural variants as well as repeat expansions using whole-genome sequencing data.
