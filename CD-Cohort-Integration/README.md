## 0. Introduction to CIWG
The Complex Disease - Cohort Integration Working Group (CIWG) aims to bring together clinical information and biosamples from 100,000 individuals with Parkinson‚Äôs disease (PD) who have donated their time and effort to help us understand and treat the disease.

We are assembling clinical and genetic data from eligible existing cohorts, as well as new cohorts of individuals with PD and healthy controls as part of the global collaboration. We have made great strides in PD research by comparing the genetic makeup of affected people with unaffected controls. This has enabled us to understand risk factor genes.

As part of this study we aim to understand variations between people with PD. For example, why some people progress slowly and some quickly and why some people develop side effects to medication and others have no problems. To understand this, we need to study genetic and clinical data together and we are collaborating with clinical cohorts worldwide to collate and study this data.

## 1. Objectives of CIWG

**The clinical cohorts integration working group (CIWG) was established to 
enable interaction with PD cohorts around the world for case control and genotype/phenotype analysis**

Our protocols provide guidelines on clinical data collection and consent for future cohorts, and create a blueprint for open-access collaborative consortia pooling PD cohorts. 

### 1A. Protocols Manuscript 
Protocols manuscript is ***in preparation***, and will be linked here when published.

## 2. CIWG Data Dictionary
### Overview 
Each joining cohort is to provide their data dictionary (as used in their database) detailing how the data scales are encoded in the clinical data they will provide. 

This data dictionary is necessary to be able to map the data provided onto the standard data format which is used for harmonization. 

If a data dictionary is *not* available, a list of variable names can be sent in advance and data recoding will be based on the full dataset when this is transferred. 

### Link to Data Dictionary 
**CIWG has created tiered system of recommended data collection items**
